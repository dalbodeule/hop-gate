HopGate System Architecture Diagram Instruction

Please draw a clean, modern system architecture diagram for a project called "HopGate".

=== High-level concept ===
- HopGate is a reverse HTTP gateway.
- A single public server terminates HTTPS and exposes a tunnel endpoint (gRPC/HTTP2) to tunnel HTTP traffic to multiple clients.
- Each client runs in a private network and forwards HTTP requests to local services (127.0.0.1:PORT).

=== Main components to draw ===
1) External Users / Browsers
   - Icon group labeled "External Users / Browsers"
   - They send HTTPS requests like https://proxy.example.com/service-a/path

2) HopGate Server (Public Edge)
   - Big box titled "HopGate Server (Public Edge)"
   - Inside this box, draw and label sub-components:
     a. "HTTPS Listener (TCP 443)"
        - Terminates TLS using ACME certificates for main and proxy domains.
     b. "HTTP Listener (TCP 80)"
        - Handles ACME HTTP-01 challenges and redirects HTTP to HTTPS.
     c. "Tunnel Endpoint (gRPC)"
        - gRPC/HTTP2 listener on the same HTTPS port (TCP 443) tunnel streams.
     d. "Admin API / Management Plane"
        - REST API base path: /api/v1/admin
        - Endpoints:
          - POST /domains/register
          - POST /domains/unregister
        - Uses "Admin API Key" via header Authorization: Bearer <key>.
     e. "Reverse Proxy Core"
        - Routes incoming HTTP(S) requests to the correct client based on domain and path.
     f. "ACME Certificate Manager"
        - Automatically issues and renews TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt).
     g. "Tunnel Session Manager"
        - Manages tunnel connections and per-domain sessions with clients
          (gRPC streams).
     h. "Metrics & Logging"
        - Structured JSON logs shipped to Prometheus / Loki / Grafana stack.

3) Database Layer
   - Box labeled "PostgreSQL + ent ORM"
   - Connected to the Admin API / Management Plane.
   - Stores "Domain" entities:
     - UUID id
     - domain (FQDN)
     - client_api_key (64 chars)
     - memo
     - timestamps

4) HopGate Clients (Private Networks)
   - Draw 2–3 separate client boxes to show that multiple clients can connect.
   - Each box titled "HopGate Client".
   - Inside each client box, show:
     a. "Tunnel Client"
        - gRPC client that opens a long-lived bi-directional gRPC stream over HTTPS (HTTP/2).
     b. "Client Proxy"
        - Receives HTTP request frames from the server over the tunnel (gRPC stream).
        - Forwards them to local services such as:
          - 127.0.0.1:8080 (web)
     c. "Local Services"
        - A small group of boxes representing local HTTP servers.

=== Flows to highlight ===
1) User HTTP Flow
   - External user -> HTTPS Listener -> Reverse Proxy Core ->
       gRPC Tunnel Endpoint -> specific HopGate Client (gRPC stream) -> Local Service ->
       back through same path to the user.

2) Admin Flow
   - Administrator -> Admin API (with Bearer admin key) -> PostgreSQL + ent ORM:
     - Register domain + memo -> returns client_api_key.
     - Unregister domain + client_api_key.

3) Tunnel Handshake / Session Establishment Flow
   - v1:  DTLS Handshake Flow (legacy) - (REMOVED)
   - v2: gRPC Tunnel Establishment Flow:
     - From client to server over HTTPS (HTTP/2):
       - Client opens a long-lived bi-directional gRPC stream (e.g. OpenTunnel).
       - First frame includes {domain, client_api_key} and client metadata.
       - Server validates against PostgreSQL Domain table and associates the gRPC stream with that domain.
       - Subsequent frames carry HTTP request/response metadata and body chunks.

=== Visual style ===
- Clean flat design, no 3D.
- Use distinct colors for:
  - public zone (internet + HopGate Server),
  - database,
  - each client / private network.
- Ensure labels are readable and precise.
- The overall layout should clearly show:
  - Internet (top or left),
  - HopGate Server in the center,
  - Database near the server,
  - Multiple clients and their local services on the right or bottom.

Please output a single high-resolution architecture diagram that matches this description.
